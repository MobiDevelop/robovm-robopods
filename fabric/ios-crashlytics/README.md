# Crashlytics iOS Framework

### RoboVM Configuration
In addition to adding the robopod and framework dependencies, Crashlytics requires the following symbols to run. Add these into `robovm.xml`

```
    <exportedSymbols>
        <symbol>CLS*</symbol>
    </exportedSymbols>
```

### Initialization

Use `Signals.installSignals()` to initialize Crashlytics. More information is available [in this blog post](https://dkimitsa.github.io/2019/02/21/mach-exception-handler-and-crashlytics/).

You need to configure Robovm to report uncaught exceptions as crashes. Call `org.robovm.apple.foundation.NSException#registerDefaultJavaUncaughtExceptionHandler` in `com.badlogic.gdx.backends.iosrobovm.IOSApplication.Delegate#didFinishLaunching`.

```java
@Override
public boolean didFinishLaunching(UIApplication application, UIApplicationLaunchOptions launchOptions) {
    super.didFinishLaunching(application, launchOptions);
    Signals.installSignals(() -> {
        Fabric.with(Crashlytics.class);
    }, true);
    NSException.registerDefaultJavaUncaughtExceptionHandler();
    return true;
}
```

Additionally you can add this line to enable debug:
```java
Crashlytics.getSharedInstance().setDebugMode(true);
```

### Uploading dSYMs
Fabric includes a tool to automatically upload your projectâ€™s dSYM, but this only works for XCode projects.

dSYM files can be uploaded manually using the `upload-symbols` script included with the Fabric OS X app. Typical usage is as follows:

```sh
/Applications/Fabric.app/Contents/MacOS/upload-symbols -a <api-key> -p ios robovm/build/robovm/<your-app-name>.dSYM
```

More info [in the official Fabric documentation](https://docs.fabric.io/apple/crashlytics/missing-dsyms.html#upload-symbols-script).
